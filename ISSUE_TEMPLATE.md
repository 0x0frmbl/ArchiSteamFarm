I fully read and understood **[contributing](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)** guidelines of ASF, especially the point that GITHUB IS NOT TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND IT'S THE PLACE ONLY FOR ASF BUGS AND SUGGESTIONS.

I admit that THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OR TECHNICAL ISSUE caused by my lazyness of reading ASF **[wiki](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki)**. I strongly believe that the bug I'm reporting here affects majority of ASF users, and the enhancement I'm suggesting could benefit ASF in long-run.

If my issue is not meeting contributing guidelines specified above, please close my issue immediately - I won't complain.
